# Welcome to the KPMP (Kidney Precision Medicine Project) Github

You can learn more about the project at [KPMP.org](http://kpmp.org).

This is the public repository of all of the projects that the University of Michigan software team have built to support KPMP. Additionally, there are a number of repositories here that are associated with published papers.

## Notes
Each repository uses a codename followed by a dash and typically either web or data. The '-web' repsitories contain the front-end code for the application, whereas the '-data' repositories contain the service-layer code for the application.

heavens-docker contains most of the docker-container yaml files for our applications at the moment. It also contains some shared Docker containers that are used across multiple applications.

There are a number of other repositories that do not use codenames, these are typically a little more self-explanatory. Additionally, we have added topics to many of the repositories to make it easier to find their related repos.
